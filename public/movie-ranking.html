<h3>Madagascar 3 ꕥ</h3>
Amazing animation. Loved the concept.
<h3>The Cat(2011) /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\</h3>
I loved the entire concept, the cinematography, the visual effects. Disappointingly underrated. Best horror film ever.
<h3>Yes Day ☆</h3>
Very fun while also showing a few realistic concepts, other than that the film is rather whimsical.
<h3>Inside The Mind Of a Cat /ᐠ. ᴗ.ᐟ\</h3>
Probably the cutest documentary ever. Full of adorable felines.
